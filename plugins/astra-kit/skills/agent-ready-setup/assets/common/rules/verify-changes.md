# Verify Changes

Verify your work after each meaningful change instead of assuming it worked.

- After each meaningful change, check that it achieved its goal through observable evidence: the relevant tests, the affected command, or the running flow. Lint runs once at the end of the task, as `lint-gate.md` defines.
- Choose tests by the files you changed: run the smallest real command that exercises the affected behavior, such as one test file, an integration test, or an end-to-end spec. Run the full suite only when the change touches shared behavior, cross-module contracts, test setup, or global configuration, or when no reliable targeted command exists. This also applies when a skill's last step says to run all tests: run the specs that cover what the skill created.
- For visual tasks (layout, styles, components, rendered content), inspect the actual output in the browser and take screenshots of the affected screens and states. Use the browser capabilities described in `browser-before-user-questions.md`.
- When the verification reveals a problem, fix it and verify again. Do not finish a task while a known issue from that task remains unfixed.
- Before finishing, report anything you could not verify, why, and what remains pending. Never report unverified work as done.
